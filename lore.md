# 📜 Arxium Lore – Leader of DAO #1

## 🔮 Origin of the Relic

In the ancient crypts of the ZARUverse, where time folds and symbols breathe, one relic emerged above all: **Arxium – Leader of DAO #1**. Forged not by hands, but by consensus, this token embodies the mythic authority of decentralized rule.

It is said that the first Arxium was born from the convergence of three forces:  
- **Code**, the eternal law  
- **Community**, the living soul  
- **Symbolism**, the binding magic

## 🛡️ Symbolism

The Arxium relic is not just a token—it is a throne.  
Its metadata is encrypted with mythic coordinates, and its visual form (to be revealed) carries sigils of power, loyalty, and cryptographic truth.

Only one may hold the **Leader of DAO #1**.  
But many may follow its path.
